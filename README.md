Introducing! The newest collection of perfboards made specifically for the Schulich School of Engineering Makermultipliex and Zetta.

Created to add some flair to normal perfboards. The new makerspace perfboards come in a variety of different sizes and styles to suit your needs! Featuring breadboard-style interconnects, these boards make soldering prototype circuits a breeze.
Optional solder bridges that tie together power rails add more customizability than ever before. 

Sales pitch aside, these are just some normal breadboard-style perfboards with branding and some solder bridges for the power rails. Simple to use but effective, the contents of this repo should contain all the files necessary to order more boards, including a panelized file that includes all the perfboards on one board should you wish to order a panel instead of individual pieces.
